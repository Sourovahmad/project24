                    <p>Itâ€™s a crooked place this town, a desperate place, full of gangsters and corruption.
                        Most people, go about their lives, avoiding dark alleys and late nights; but there
                        are some who live for those places. They love the night and live for danger, and they
                        take to the streets. Three Cartels run this city, producing $POWDER and fighting for
                        territory. There are still a few cops that fight hard to protect the city but the Cartels
                        have managed to turn most of them corrupt. The deal is they pay the Cops a tax on all
                        $POWDER produced. In exchange, the Cops will turn a blind eye to the illegal operations.
